# C++ Exam

This folder contains the implementation of a Binary Search Tree class. For a brief report refer to **REPORT.md**.

The source code is divided into folders

The *"inc"* folder contains:
-  the file **bst.h** contains the declaration of the classes:
   - `Tree`
   - `Node`
   - `Iterator`
   - `ConstIterator`
   - the implementation of the shortest members

The *"src"* folder contains the file **bst.cc** in which the implementation of the functions of the Bst class is listed.

The *"Doxygen"* folder contains the file **doxy.in** which is used to generate the code documentation.

The *"misc"* folder contains the file **misc.h** in which are defined a few ancillary functions and structure used for testing the code.


The **Makefile** provided allows to compile the code.
